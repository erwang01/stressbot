# stressbot
Facebook Messenger chatbot for Stressed Teens.

## The Problem
Facebook Messenger group chats unfortunately lack the ability to pin important messages, making collaboration in large groups, especially those filled with teens who love to meme around with their friends challenging. Often times the serious messages are not only frowned upon by the fun loving, procratination minded teens but also burried under the thousands of gifs and one letter strings of messages.

## The Solution
The stressbot allows users to "pin" messages by saving it, allowing users to quickly call back these saved messages with a few short taps and remind their fellow group members of said message.
Furthermore, the stressbot monitors a user's messaging behavior when using the service to caution against
- the use of strong, potentially offending words
- suicidal thoughts and jokes
- other indicators of stress detected by AI.
